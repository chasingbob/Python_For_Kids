All the code examples for Cambridge AS level computer science

## Fundamentally algorithms are made up of 
    * Sequence [algorithms_sequence.py] (https://github.com/chasingbob/Python_For_Kids/blob/master/algorithms_sequence.py)
    * Assignment [algorithms_assignment.py] (https://github.com/chasingbob/Python_For_Kids/blob/master/algorithms_assignment.py)
    * Selection [algorithms_selection.py] (https://github.com/chasingbob/Python_For_Kids/blob/master/algorithms_selection.py)
    * Repitition [algorithms_repitition.py] (https://github.com/chasingbob/Python_For_Kids/blob/master/algorithms_repitition.py)

Most algorithms will use a combination of the four principles. [algorithms_combination.py] (https://github.com/chasingbob/Python_For_Kids/blob/master/algorithms_combination.py)
